# VTE Analysis

This repository contains the full data analysis and the final report on a project I worked on as a research volunteer in UTSC under Dr. Federico Carini and Professor Sotirious Damouras. The research is a retrospective study on the development of a disease called venous thromboembolism (VTE) in ICU patients. Due to the nature of the confidentiality of patients' data, I cannot share the raw dataset here, and instead only the code and reports that I have made on my end.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any feedback on how to write a better report.

UPDATE: Here is the link to the final published paper ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173572724001413))
